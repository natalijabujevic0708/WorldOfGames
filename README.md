### Typography
 - The "Source Sans Pro" font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 
### Imagery
- Imagery is important. There is a video in the header and its purpose is to be striking and catch the user's attention.

# Features


## Navigation bar and Footer
* Each page features a **navigation bar** that includes Home, Guess the number, Memory and High scores.
On a screen size smaller than a tablet the navbar becomes a collapsible element. 

* Each page features **social media links**  at the bottom. They redirect a user to the social media platform opening it in a new window.


## Home page
* Users can learn about the purpose of the site on the Home page.

## Guess the number game
* Users have to guess a number from 1 to 500. They are given hints if the number they guessed is too high or low.

* When a user guesses the correct number, there is a pop-up asking their username. After the user writes it, they are informed of their result (number of guesses) and the high score table appears listing the top 5 scores for that game.

## Memory game
* Users have to flip the cards and match the symbols in pairs.

* When all the pairs are matched, there is a pop-up asking a username. After the user writes it, they are informed of their result (number of tries) and the high score table appears listing the top 5 scores for that game.

## High scores
* There is a High score page with the high scores for both games that can be accessed through the navigation bar or with a link under the description of each game on the Home page.
